# Daffodil Editor

I'm making a Mother's Day card. I want a face-on geometric drawing of
a daffodil, perhaps looking like something from a spirograph. Later
I will trace it and turn it into a lino print. But because I have the
power, I'll use a computer to draw it.

I vibe-coded this in Cursor - it took a few abortive goes before settling
on trios of super-ellipses for the petals (I started with Rose Curves)
